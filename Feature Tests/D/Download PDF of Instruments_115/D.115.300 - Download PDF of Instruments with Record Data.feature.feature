Feature: D.115.300 - The system shall support the ability to download the PDF of record data of all instruments/events

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that download PDF of record data of all instruments/events is working as expected

  Scenario: Download PDF of record data of all instruments/events 
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    Then I create a new project named "D.115.300" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_redcap_val_.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    And I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
    And I click on the button labeled "Designate Instruments for My Events"
    When I click on the button labeled "Begin Editing"
    And I enable the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" for the Event named "Event 2"
    And I enable the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" for the Event named "Event Three"
    And I click on the button labeled "Save" on the Designate Instruments for My Events page
    Then I verify the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" is enabled for the Event named "Event 2"
    And I verify the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" is enabled for the Event named "Event Three"

    Given I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
    When I locate the bubble for the "Text Validation" instrument on event "Event 2" for record ID "1" and click on the bubble
    Then I enter "Joe" into the input field labeled "Name"
    And I select the submit option labeled "Save & Exit Form" on the Data Collection Instrument

    Given I click on the bubble for the "Text Validation" data collection instrument for event "Event Three"
    Then I enter "John" into the input field labeled "Name"
    And I select the submit option labeled "Save & Exit Form" on the Data Collection Instrument

    #VERIFY
