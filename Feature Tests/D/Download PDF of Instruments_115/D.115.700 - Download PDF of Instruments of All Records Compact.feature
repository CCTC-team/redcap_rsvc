Feature: D.115.700 - The system shall support the ability to download the PDF of data of all instruments/events in a compact mode (fields with data only) of all records

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to be able to download the PDF of data of all instruments/events (compact mode) of all records

  Scenario: Download PDF of data of all instruments/events (compact mode) of all records
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    Then I create a new project named "D.115.700" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "redcap_val/Project_redcap_val.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    When I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
    And I locate the bubble for the "Text Validation" instrument on event "Event 1" for record ID "1" and click on the bubble
    And I enter "Dave" into the data entry form field labeled "Name"
    Then I enter "dave@abc.com" into the data entry form field labeled "Email"
    And I select the submit option labeled "Save & Exit Form" on the Data Collection Instrument

    Given I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
    And I click on the button labeled "Add new record for this arm"
    And I click the bubble to add a record for the "Text Validation" longitudinal instrument on event "Event 1"
    Then I should see "Adding new Record ID 2"
    And I enter "Paul" into the data entry form field labeled "Name"
    And I select the submit option labeled "Save & Exit Form" on the Data Collection Instrument
    Then I should see "Record ID 2 successfully added."

    Given I click on the link labeled "Data Exports, Reports, and Stats"
    And I click on the tab labeled "Other Export Options"
    And I click on the icon "Compact PDF" to download "PDF of data collection instruments containing saved data (all records)"  
    Then I should see the following values in the downloaded PDF

    # Checking for Identifier field twice doesn't work as expected in ATS as it might just check the first Identifier row for all the 2 entries. 
    # But keeping it for manual testing.
    # Not verifying Name field in Data Types in Record ID 1 (Event 1) and Email field in Text Validation in Record ID 2 (Event 1) as ATS will fail. 
    # Name is present with values of Dave and Paul in PDF
