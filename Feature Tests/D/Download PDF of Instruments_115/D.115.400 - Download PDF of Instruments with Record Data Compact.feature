Feature: D.115.400 - The system shall support the ability to download the PDF of record data of all instruments/events in a compact mode (fields with data only) 

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that download PDF of record data of all instruments/events (compact) is working as expected

  Scenario: Download  PDF of record data of all instruments/events (compact)
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    Then I create a new project named "D.115.400" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "redcap_val/Project_redcap_val.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    And I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
    And I click on the button labeled "Designate Instruments for My Events"
    When I click on the button labeled "Begin Editing"
    And I enable the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" for the Event named "Event 2"
    And I enable the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" for the Event named "Event Three"
    And I click on the button labeled "Save" on the Designate Instruments for My Events page
    Then I verify the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" is enabled for the Event named "Event 2"
    And I verify the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation" is enabled for the Event named "Event Three"

    Given I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
    When I locate the bubble for the "Text Validation" instrument on event "Event 2" for record ID "1" and click on the bubble
    Then I enter "Joe" into the input field labeled "Name"
    And I select the submit option labeled "Save & Exit Form" on the Data Collection Instrument

    Given I click the bubble to select a record for the "Text Validation" longitudinal instrument on event "Event Three"
    Then I enter "John" into the input field labeled "Name"
    And I select the submit option labeled "Save & Exit Form" on the Data Collection Instrument

    Given I click on the button labeled "Choose action for record"
    And I click on the link labeled "Download PDF of record data for all instruments/events (compact)"
    Then I should see the following values in the downloaded PDF
