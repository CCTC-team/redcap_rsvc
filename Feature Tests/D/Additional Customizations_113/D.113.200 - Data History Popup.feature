Feature: D.113.200 - The system shall support the ability to enable/disable Data History Popup for all data collection instruments.

      As a REDCap end user
      I want to see that Data History Popup is functioning as expected

      Scenario: Enable Data History Popup
            Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin" 
            And I create a new project named "D.113.200" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "redcap_val/Project_redcap_val.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

            #ACTION: Enable Data History Popup 
            Given I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
            And I click on the button labeled "Additional customizations"
            Then I should see a checkbox labeled Enable the Data History popup for all data collection instruments that is checked in additional customizations
            And I click on the button labeled "Cancel" in the dialog box
            
            #VERIFY - Data History Popup entries
            Given I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
            When I locate the bubble for the "Text Validation" instrument on event "Event 1" for record ID "1" and click on the bubble
            Then I should see the History icon for the field labeled "Name"
