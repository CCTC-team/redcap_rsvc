Feature: D.112.100 - The system shall support the ability to send password over emails when a user is created, or password is changed.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that User Password Strategy is functioning as expected

    Scenario: User Password Strategy (created, reset and changed)
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"   
        And I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        # EMAIL ADDRESS SET FOR REDCAP ADMIN - without it, emails are not send out from system
        Given I click on the link labeled "General Configuration"
        Then I should see "General Configuration"
        When I enter "redcap@test.instance" into the input field labeled "Email Address of REDCap Administrator"
        And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        Then I should see "Your system configuration values have now been changed"
        
        And I click on the link labeled "Add Users (Table-based Only)"
        Then I should see "User Management for Table-based Authentication" 
        When I enter "Test_User5" into the input field labeled "Username:" 
        And I enter "Test" into the input field labeled "First name:"

        And I enter "Test_User5@example.com" into the input field labeled "Primary email:"
        And I click on the button labeled "Save"
        Then I should see "User has been successfully saved."      
        And I should see "User has been successfully saved. An email with login information was sent to: Test_User5@example.com"   
        And I logout

        ##VERIFY: Verify email in MailHog and set password
        Given I open Email
        Then I should see an email for user "Test_User5@example.com" with subject "REDCap access granted"

        Then I should see "Set Your Password"
