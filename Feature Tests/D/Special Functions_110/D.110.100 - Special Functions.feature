Feature: D.110.100 Special Functions  - The system shall support the ability to use Special Functions in data entry forms. The following subset of Special Functions is selected and tested: 
    D.110.100.1 - datediff 
    D.110.100.2 - round  
    D.110.100.3 - if 
    D.110.100.4 - mean 
    D.110.100.5 - length 

  As a REDCap end user
